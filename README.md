# LabLib
DataScience Library for Laboratory uses (Jupyter Notebook) 

The main file is LAB_LIB_AP-SP.py (at the end of the work will be added a list of dependences nedded). 

The object is to make a better version of the existing library-examples (like G_PURI_lib.py, my_lib_santanastasio_v2.py, my_lib_santanastasio.py). Once the work is finished, the other libraries will be deleted.

Every test file used will be attached to EXP1_MOD.py
