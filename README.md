# LabLib
DataScience Library for Laboratory uses (Jupyter Notebook) 

The main file is LAB_LIB_AP-SP.py (at the end of the work will be added a list of dependences nedded). 

The final result is going to be a better versione of the library-examples (G_PURI_lib.py, my_lib_santanastasio_v2.py, my_lib_santanastasio.py).

Every test file used will be attached to <\bold>XP1_MOD.py<\bold>
